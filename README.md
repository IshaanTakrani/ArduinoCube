# ArduinoCube

This is the Arduino Cube repository!

It was made for students in the TER3M0 course at Castlebrooke Secondary School,
and will be taught as official curricula for the computer engineering: robotics and control systems course.

This repo holds the example code showcased in the lessons and the answer key to the tasks, as well as a PDF version of the slideshow that contains the lessons.
The lesson powerpoint (reccomended) can be viewed and downloaded here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1S3UAXp1IjQZTg-afuU-j-TbsonQ4jc3X/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=117477687868879843343&rtpof=true&sd=true, or can be provided upon request.


All of the programs run on an Arduino Uno microcontroller, and require the Arduino IDE

Happy learning!
