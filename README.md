# ArduinoCube

This is the Arduino Cube repository!

It was made for students in the TER3M0 course at Castlebrooke Secondary School,
and will be taught as official curricula for the computer engineering: robotics and control systems course.

This repo holds the example code showcased in the lessons and the answer key to the tasks, as well as two PDF versions of the slideshows that contains the lessons.
The lesson powerpoints (recommended) can be viewed and downloaded here:
|PowerPoint|Topics|Link|
|---|---|---|
|Part 1|IDE, Programming Basics, LED, Functions, For loops, NeoPixel Ring, Piezo Buzzer|https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13y1Mgm2tBhPKN-QdnhDZE5IgwPdcVHN8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117477687868879843343&rtpof=true&sd=true|
|part 2|Matrix, Ultrasonic, Photoresistor, LCD, Bluetooth|https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LXxexhgsNVkRQBy4GGPhFvleU5gOwyzL/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117477687868879843343&rtpof=true&sd=true|



All of the programs run on an Arduino Uno, and use the Arduino IDE. PlatformIO should also work

Happy learning!
